/**
 * Represents a Mutation of a document. Different subclasses of Mutation will
 * perform different kinds of changes to a base document. For example, a
 * SetMutation replaces the value of a document and a DeleteMutation deletes a
 * document.
 *
 * In addition to the value of the document mutations also operate on the
 * version. For local mutations (mutations that haven't been committed yet), we
 * preserve the existing version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. For
 * local deletes, we reset the version to 0.
 *
 * Here's the expected transition table.
 *
 * MUTATION           APPLIED TO      RESULTS IN
 * SetMutation        Document(v3)    Document(v3)
 * SetMutation        NoDocument(v3)  Document(v0)
 * SetMutation        null            Document(v0)
 * PatchMutation      Document(v3)    Document(v3)
 * PatchMutation      NoDocument(v3)  NoDocument(v3)
 * PatchMutation      null            null
 * TransformMutation  Document(v3)    Document(v3)
 * TransformMutation  NoDocument(v3)  NoDocument(v3)
 * TransformMutation  null            null
 * DeleteMutation     Document(v3)    NoDocument(v0)
 * DeleteMutation     NoDocument(v3)  NoDocument(v0)
 * DeleteMutation     null            NoDocument(v0)
 *
 * For acknowledged mutations, we use the update_time of the WriteResponse as
 * the resulting version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. As deletes
 * have no explicit update time, we use the commit_time of the WriteResponse
 * for acknowledged deletes.
 *
 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition
 * check locally, we return an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us
 * the updated version.
 *
 * Note that TransformMutations don't create Documents (in the case of being
 * applied to a NoDocument), even though they would on the backend. This is
 * because the client always combines the TransformMutation with a SetMutation
 * or PatchMutation and we only want to apply the transform if the prior
 * mutation resulted in a Document (always true for a SetMutation, but not
 * necessarily for an PatchMutation).
 *
 * Note: Mutation and its subclasses are specially designed to avoid slicing.
 * You can assign a subclass of Mutation to an instance of Mutation and the
 * full value is preserved, unsliced. Each subclass declares an explicit
 * constructor that can recover the derived type. This means that code like
 * this will work:
 *
 *     SetMutation set(...);
 *     Mutation mutation = set;
 *     SetMutation recovered(mutation);
 *
 * The final line results in an explicit check that will fail if the type of
 * the underlying data is not actually Type::Set.

   *     input document can be nullopt if the client has no knowledge of the
