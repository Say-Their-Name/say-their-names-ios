While her mother and brother were in the hallway of their apartment building, police entered the 24th floor apartment after Korchinski-Paquet, who went to use the bathroom. The family heard Korchinski-Paquet cry for help, followed by quiet, and then the officers confirming that she had fallen off the balcony. Korchinski-Paquet fell from the balcony to the ground below, and died at the scene. Her family accused the officers of pushing her off the balcony, which has led to a Special Investigations Unit investigation.
