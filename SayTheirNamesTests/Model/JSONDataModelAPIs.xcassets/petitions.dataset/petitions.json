Ramarley Graham was spotted adjusting the waistband of his pants during a NYPD narcotics squad surveillance of a bodega near his home. Officers assumed Graham was concealing a gun. When plainclothes officers approached Graham, they reported that he ran to the home of Patricia Hartley, his grandmother, a few blocks away. Surveillance footage from outside the front entrance to Hartley\u2019s building, however, shows Graham calmly walking up to the door and entering without urgency. The same surveillance footage shows two officers running up to the building with their guns drawn just moments after Graham enters. As the two officers try to force their way through the locked door, other NYPD officers gained entrance through the rear of the building and opened the front door. One officer ran upstairs to Hartley\u2019s apartment and broke down the door without a search warrant or announcing that he was a police officer. Plainclothes Officer Richard Haste then ran into the apartment and discovered Graham in the bathroom attempting to flush a bag of marijuana down the toilet. Without any orders to comply, Graham was shot once in the chest in front of his little brother, Chinoor Campbell, and grandmother. Haste later reported that Graham reached into his waistband for a gun but no weapon was found in the Hartley apartment. In 2012, a grand jury voted to indict Haste, but the indictment was tossed out due to a prosecutorial mistake. A second grand jury declined to indict Haste, allowing him to walk free. After further investigation during a departmental trial in March 2017, Haste was found guilty on all charges and turned in his badge and gun before Deputy Commissioner of Trials, Rosemarie Maldonado, asked Police Commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, to fire him","outcome":null,"biography":null,"images":[{"id":10,"person_id":10,"image_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/ramarley-graham\/ramarley-graham.jpg"}],"sharable_links":{"base":"https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/ramarley-graham","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/ramarley-graham","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/ramarley-graham","whatsapp":"https:\/\/wa.me\/?text=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/ramarley-graham"},"media":[{"id":10,"person_id":10,"image_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/ramarley-graham\/ramarley-graham.jpg"}]},"type":{"id":1,"type":"Victims"}},{"id":5,"identifier":"petition-for-edson-da-costa","title":"Petition For Edson Da Costa","description":"Help bring justice to Edson Da Costa by signing this petition","outcome":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/metropolitan-police-commissioner-suspend-police-officers-under-investigation-for-deaths-of-edson-da-costa-rashan-charles","outcome_img_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/petition.png","banner_img_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/petition.png","sharable_links":{"base":"https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","whatsapp":"https:\/\/wa.me\/?text=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/"},"person":{"id":11,"full_name":"Edson Da Costa","identifier":"edson-da-costa","date_of_incident":1498003200,"number_of_children":2,"age":25,"city":"London","country":"United Kingdom","their_story":"Edson Da Costa died after being detained by London police using force","outcome":null,"biography":null,"images":[{"id":11,"person_id":11,"image_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/edson-dacosta\/edson-dacosta.jpg"}],"sharable_links":{"base":"https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/edson-da-costa","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/edson-da-costa","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/edson-da-costa","whatsapp":"https:\/\/wa.me\/?text=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/edson-da-costa"},"media":[{"id":11,"person_id":11,"image_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/edson-dacosta\/edson-dacosta.jpg"}]},"type":{"id":1,"type":"Victims"}},{"id":6,"identifier":"petition-for-kimani-gray","title":"Petition For Kimani Gray","description":"Help bring justice to Kimani Gray by signing this petition","outcome":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.thepetitionsite.com\/en-gb\/597\/528\/146\/demand-justice-for-kimani-gray\/","outcome_img_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/petition.png","banner_img_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/petition.png","sharable_links":{"base":"https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","whatsapp":"https:\/\/wa.me\/?text=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/"},"person":{"id":12,"full_name":"Kimani Gray","identifier":"kimani-gray","date_of_incident":1362787200,"number_of_children":null,"age":16,"city":"New York - NY","country":"United States","their_story":"Kimani Gray was 16 when he was shot 7 times and killed by undercover police.

Her mother, Claudette Beals-Clayton, called for police assistance after a domestic conflict with a request to take her daughter to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). While her mother and brother were in the hallway of their apartment building, police entered the 24th floor apartment after Korchinski-Paquet, who went to use the bathroom. The family heard Korchinski-Paquet cry for help, followed by quiet, and then the officers confirming that she had fallen off the balcony. Korchinski-Paquet fell from the balcony to the ground below, and died at the scene. Her family accused the officers of pushing her off the balcony, which has led to a Special Investigations Unit investigation. Korchinski-Paquet's death has inspired a number of protests in Canada against police involvement in her death and other issues of anti-black and anti-indigenous racism. These protests occurred at the same time as the George Floyd protests.","outcome":null,"biography":null,"images":[{"id":18,"person_id":18,"image_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/regis-korchinskipaquet\/regis-korchinskipaquet.jpg"}],"sharable_links":{"base":"https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/regis-korchinski-paquet","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/regis-korchinski-paquet","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/regis-korchinski-paquet","whatsapp":"https:\/\/wa.me\/?text=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/regis-korchinski-paquet"},"media":[{"id":18,"person_id":18,"image_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/regis-korchinskipaquet\/regis-korchinskipaquet.jpg"}]},"type":{"id":1,"type":"Victims"}},{"id":10,"identifier":"petition-for-george-floyd","title":"Petition For George Floyd","description":"Help bring justice to George Floyd by signing this petition","outcome":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/mayor-jacob-frey-justice-for-george-floyd","outcome_img_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/petition.png","banner_img_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/petition.png","sharable_links":{"base":"https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/","whatsapp":"https:\/\/wa.me\/?text=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/petition\/"},"person":{"id":23,"full_name":"George Floyd","identifier":"george-floyd","date_of_incident":1590364800,"number_of_children":2,"age":46,"city":"Minnesota","country":"United States","their_story":"Officers responding to a \"forgery in progress\" detained Floyd, kneeling on his neck for several minutes.
