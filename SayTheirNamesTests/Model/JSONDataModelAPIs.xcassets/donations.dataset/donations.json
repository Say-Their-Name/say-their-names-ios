Her mother, Claudette Beals-Clayton, called for police assistance after a domestic conflict with a request to take her daughter to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). While her mother and brother were in the hallway of their apartment building, police entered the 24th floor apartment after Korchinski-Paquet, who went to use the bathroom. The family heard Korchinski-Paquet cry for help, followed by quiet, and then the officers confirming that she had fallen off the balcony. Korchinski-Paquet fell from the balcony to the ground below, and died at the scene. Her family accused the officers of pushing her off the balcony, which has led to a Special Investigations Unit investigation. Korchinski-Paquet's death has inspired a number of protests in Canada against police involvement in her death and other issues of anti-black and anti-indigenous racism. These protests occurred at the same time as the George Floyd protests.","outcome":null,"biography":null,"images":[{"id":18,"person_id":18,"image_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/regis-korchinskipaquet\/regis-korchinskipaquet.jpg"}],"sharable_links":{"base":"https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/regis-korchinski-paquet","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/regis-korchinski-paquet","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/regis-korchinski-paquet","whatsapp":"https:\/\/wa.me\/?text=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/people\/regis-korchinski-paquet"},"media":[{"id":18,"person_id":18,"image_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/regis-korchinskipaquet\/regis-korchinskipaquet.jpg"}]},"type":{"id":1,"type":"Victims"}},{"id":2,"identifier":"donate-to-michael-powell","title":"Donate to Michael Powell","description":"Donate Michael Powell by donating here","outcome":null,"link":"https:\/\/mikeypowell-campaign.org.uk\/donations\/","outcome_img_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/petition.png","banner_img_url":"https:\/\/say-their-names.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com\/petition.png","sharable_links":{"base":"https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/donations\/","facebook":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/donations\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/home?status=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/donations\/","whatsapp":"https:\/\/wa.me\/?text=https:\/\/www.saythiernames.io\/donations\/"},"person":{"id":19,"full_name":"Michael Powell","identifier":"michael-powell","date_of_incident":1062892800,"number_of_children":null,"age":38,"city":"Birmingham","country":"United Kingdom","their_story":"Mikey Powell, 38, tragically died of asphyxiation while in custody after an arrest over a disturbance at his home in Lozells.
